## Maintenance
- Dependency versions are defined in the `gradle.properties` file. If anything needs updating do it from here.
- Also, if new dependencies need to be added in the project `build.gradle` file, please make sure to add their versions to `gradle.properties` as well.
- Compose related dependencies do not require their own version. They are handled through the `compose_bom_version` so make sure you only update the compose bom.
